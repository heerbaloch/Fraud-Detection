# Fraud-Detection
Our basic goal is to  reduce fraud with the help of machine learning, to help firms and people catch such  frauds easily.
Manual detection of fraud is impractical due to the volume and complexity of transactions. Machine learning can automate the detection process, learning from historical transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities.


##Tools and Libraries Used
Python: A versatile programming language, ideal for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
Matplotlib:  plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Key Analyses Conducted
Data Preparation: The dataset was cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates, ensuring the integrity of subsequent analyses.

Variable Identification: We identified variable types within the dataset, distinguishing between numerical and categorical data.

# Fraud-Detection
Our basic goal is to  reduce fraud with the help of machine learning, to help firms and people catch such  frauds easily.
Manual detection of fraud is impractical due to the volume and complexity of transactions. Machine learning can automate the detection process, learning from historical transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities.
